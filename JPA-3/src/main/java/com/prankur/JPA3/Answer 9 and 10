Ques 10-  What does @transactional annotation do?
 Ans 10- it makes a method to a transaction
            i.e. the method will follow ACID properties of Transaction
            -> either the whole method will be completed or none will be completed
            @transactional allows for rollback too. on exceptions
            also it maintains a hibernate session

            e.g

            try{
                userTransaction.start();
                businessLogic();
                userTransaction.commit();
            } catch(Excepton ex) {
                ex.rollback();
            }
